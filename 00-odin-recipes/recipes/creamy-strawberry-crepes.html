<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>¾ cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>½ cup milk</li>
    <li>½ cup water</li>
    <li>3 eggs</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 ¼ cups sifted confectioners' sugar</li>
    <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon lemon zest</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1 cup heavy cream, whipped</li>
    <li>4 cups sliced strawberries</li>
</ul>
<h2>Step 1</h2>
Place flour, milk, water, eggs, melted butter, and salt into a blender; blend until smooth and set aside.
<h2>Step 2</h2>
Beat confectioners' sugar, cream cheese, lemon juice, lemon zest, and vanilla with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Gently fold in whipped cream.
<h2>Step 3</h2>
Heat a lightly oiled griddle or non-stick skillet over medium heat.
<h2>Step 4</h2>
Pour or scoop batter onto the griddle, using approximately 2 tablespoons for each crepe. Tip and rotate the pan to spread batter as thinly as possible. Flip over when batter is set and edges begin to brown. Continue cooking until bottom begins to brown. Stack finished crepes on a plate; cover with a damp towel.
<h2>Step 5</h2>
Fill each crepe with 1/4 cup sliced strawberries and 1/3 cup cream cheese filling. Roll up and top with a dollop of cream cheese filling and more sliced strawberries
